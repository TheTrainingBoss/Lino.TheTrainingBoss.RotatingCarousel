# Lino.TheTrainingBoss.RotatingCarousel
This is a sample Sitefinity MVC widget to show how to build one in an external assembly and assign a new icon for it in the Sitefinity Designer

How to install it in your site?
-------------------------------
The only file you need is the assembly file **Lino.TheTrainingBoss.RotatingCarousel.dll**  
I placed this assembly here in the repository in case you just want to use it right away and you might not yet be interested in the source code.
[The binary](https://github.com/TheTrainingBoss/Lino.TheTrainingBoss.RotatingCarousel/blob/master/Binary%20Release/Lino.TheTrainingBoss.RotatingCarousel.dll)

Place that file in your bin folder of your Sitefinity site (currently it is compiled against 12.1.7100)  if you have a different version of Sitefinity just add Assembly Binding Dependencies in your Web.Config file to get it to work.
Or better yet, open the project in Visual Studio and upgrade or downgrade the NuGet packages to meet your sitefinity version needs.
